        <h1>Kharif Cropping Season</h1>
        <p>
            The Kharif cropping season, also known as the monsoon season, is an important agricultural season in India.
            It starts with the onset of the southwest monsoon in June and continues until September/October.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the Kharif season, various crops are sown, including rice, maize, cotton, sugarcane, and millets.
            These crops require ample rainfall and warm temperatures for their growth and development.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Kharif season is crucial for Indian agriculture as it contributes significantly to the country's food security and economy.
            Farmers across India eagerly await the arrival of the monsoon to begin sowing their Kharif crops.
