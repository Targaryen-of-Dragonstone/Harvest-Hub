        <h1>Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojana (PM-KMY)</h1>
        <p>
            Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojana (PM-KMY) is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme for small and marginal farmers in India.
            The scheme was launched on 12 September 2019 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main objective of the PM-KMY is to provide a guaranteed monthly pension of Rs. 3,000 to small and marginal farmers after they reach the age of 60 years.
            The scheme is open to all small and marginal farmers who are between the ages of 18 and 40 years and who have cultivable land up to 2 hectares.
        </p>
        <p>
            To join the scheme, farmers need to open a pension account with the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC).
            The minimum monthly contribution to the scheme is Rs. 55 and the maximum monthly contribution is Rs. 200.
            The contribution amount is fixed for the entire period of 20 years or until the farmer reaches the age of 60 years, whichever is earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
            The government will match the contribution made by the farmer up to a limit of Rs. 1,000 per month.
            This means that if a farmer contributes Rs. 55 per month, the government will contribute Rs. 55 per month.
            If a farmer contributes Rs. 200 per month, the government will contribute Rs. 1,000 per month.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the farmer reaches the age of 60 years, he/she will start receiving a monthly pension of Rs. 3,000.
            The pension will be paid for the rest of the farmer's life.
        </p>
        <p>
            The PM-KMY is a unique and innovative scheme that will provide a guaranteed monthly pension to small and marginal farmers in India.
            The scheme is expected to benefit millions of farmers and will help to improve their financial security in old age.
