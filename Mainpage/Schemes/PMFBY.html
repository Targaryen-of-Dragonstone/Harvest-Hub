        <h1>Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)</h1>
        <p>
            The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) is a crop insurance scheme launched by the Government of India in 2016. 
            The scheme aims to provide financial protection to farmers against crop losses due to natural calamities, pests, and diseases.
        </p>
        <p>
            The scheme is mandatory for all farmers cultivating notified crops in notified areas. The premium for the scheme is shared 
            between the government and the farmers. The government bears 50% of the premium for small and marginal farmers, while the 
            farmers bear the remaining 50%.
        </p>
        <p>
            The scheme provides coverage against crop losses due to drought, flood, hailstorm, cyclone, pests, and disease. 
            The scheme also provides coverage against post-harvest losses due to fire, theft, and other unforeseen events.
        </p>
        <p>
            The scheme is administered by the National Agricultural Insurance Company (NIAC) and its subsidiaries. The scheme has been 
            well-received by farmers and has helped to reduce their vulnerability to crop losses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are some of the benefits of the PMFBY scheme:

            vulnerability to crop losses and has helped to improve their income. The scheme is a major boost to the agricultural 
            sector and is helping to promote sustainable agriculture.
