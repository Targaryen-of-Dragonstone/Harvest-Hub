        <h1>Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY)</h1>
        <p>
            The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY) is a centrally sponsored scheme launched by the Government of India in 2015. 
            The scheme aims to provide financial assistance to farmers for the installation of micro-irrigation systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            The scheme is open to all farmers who own less than 2 hectares of land. The financial assistance is provided in the form 
            of a loan, which is to be repaid over a period of 5 years. The loan is interest-free for the first two years.
        </p>
        <p>
            The scheme has been well-received by farmers and has helped to increase the adoption of micro-irrigation systems. 
            The scheme has also helped to improve the efficiency of water use and has led to an increase in crop production.
