        <p>The history of agriculture in India dates back to the Neolithic period. India ranks second worldwide in farm outputs. As per the Indian economic survey 2020 -21, agriculture employed more than 50% of the Indian workforce and contributed 20.2% to the country's GDP.</p>

        <p>In 2016, agriculture and allied sectors like animal husbandry, forestry and fisheries accounted for 17.5% of the GDP (gross domestic product) with about 41.49% of the workforce in 2020. India ranks first in the world with highest net cropped area followed by US and China. The economic contribution of agriculture to India's GDP is steadily declining with the country's broad-based economic growth. Still, agriculture is demographically the broadest economic sector and plays a significant role in the overall socio-economic fabric of India.</p>

        <p>The total agriculture commodities export was US$3.50 billion in March - June 2020. India exported $38 billion worth of agricultural products in 2013, making it the seventh-largest agricultural exporter worldwide and the sixth largest net exporter. Most of its agriculture exports serve developing and least developed nations. Indian agricultural/horticultural and processed foods are exported to more than 120 countries, primarily to the Japan, Southeast Asia, SAARC countries, the European Union and the United States.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The agriculture sector in India is divided into several sub-sectors, including crops, horticulture, livestock, fisheries, and forestry. Each of these sub-sectors plays a crucial role in the overall agricultural landscape of the country.</p>

        <h2>Main Crops</h2>
        <p>Rice and wheat are the two main staple food crops grown in India. Other essential food crops include maize, millets, pulses, and oilseeds. India is also a significant producer of fruits, vegetables, spices, and cash crops such as cotton, sugarcane, tea, and coffee.</p>

        <h2>Farming Practices</h2>
        <p>Traditional farming methods coexist with modern agricultural practices in India. While some farmers still rely on age-old techniques such as manual plowing and sowing, others have adopted mechanized farming, drip irrigation, and greenhouse cultivation.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Indian farming faces various challenges, including small landholdings, dependence on monsoon rains, soil degradation, water scarcity, pest attacks, and market volatility. Climate change poses an additional threat, leading to erratic weather patterns and extreme events like droughts and floods.</p>

        <h2>Government Initiatives</h2>
        <p>The Indian government has launched several initiatives to address these challenges and promote sustainable agriculture. These include schemes for soil health management, water conservation, crop diversification, agricultural research, and extension services. Subsidies, credit facilities, crop insurance, and minimum support prices are also provided to support farmers.</p>

        <h2>Future Prospects</h2>
        <p>Despite the challenges, Indian agriculture holds significant potential for growth and innovation. Advancements in technology, such as precision agriculture, biotechnology, and remote sensing, offer opportunities to increase productivity, reduce environmental impact, and improve farmer livelihoods.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Indian farming is a complex and dynamic sector that continues to evolve to meet the growing demands of a rapidly expanding population. With the right policies, investments, and interventions, Indian agriculture can achieve sustainable growth, ensure food security, and contribute to the country's overall development.</p>
