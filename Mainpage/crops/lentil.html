        <h2>Lentil Details</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Name:</strong> Lens culinaris<br>
            <strong>Origin:</strong> Lentils are one of the oldest cultivated crops, believed to have originated in the Near East or Mediterranean region. They have been grown for thousands of years and are now cultivated worldwide.<br>
            <strong>Characteristics:</strong> Lentil plants are annual legumes with branching stems and compound leaves. They produce small, pale flowers that develop into pods containing 1-2 seeds each. The seeds, which are lens-shaped and come in various colors such as brown, green, and red, are the edible part of the plant.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>Lentil Growing Procedure</h2>
        <h3>January to March (Preparation and Planning)</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Site Selection and Land Preparation:</strong><br>
            Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil for planting lentils.<br>
            Clear the field of weeds, debris, and any obstacles that may hinder planting or growth.<br>
            Conduct soil tests to determine nutrient levels and pH, and amend the soil as needed.<br><br>
            <strong>Soil Preparation:</strong><br>
            Till the soil to a depth of 6-8 inches to loosen it and improve aeration.<br>
            Incorporate organic matter, such as compost or aged manure, to enrich the soil and provide essential nutrients.<br>
            Create raised beds or rows for planting, with spacing appropriate for the lentil variety.<br><br>
            <strong>Seed Selection and Treatment:</strong><br>
            Choose high-quality lentil seeds suited to your climate and soil conditions.<br>
            Treat seeds with fungicides or insecticides to protect against seed-borne diseases and pests.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>April to June (Planting and Early Growth)</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Planting:</strong><br>
            Sow lentil seeds directly into the prepared soil once the danger of frost has passed and soil temperatures reach at least 50°F (10°C).<br>
            Plant seeds at a depth of 1-2 inches and spacing of 2-4 inches apart within rows, with rows spaced 12-18 inches apart.<br>
            Ensure adequate soil moisture for germination and early growth by watering gently after planting.<br><br>
            <strong>Water Management:</strong><br>
            Maintain consistent soil moisture throughout the growing season, especially during periods of drought or heat stress.<br>
            Water lentil plants deeply and evenly, providing 1-1.5 inches of water per week, either through rainfall or irrigation.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>July to September (Growth and Development)</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Nutrient Management:</strong><br>
            Apply balanced fertilizers, rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, to support lentil growth and development.<br>
            Side-dress nitrogen fertilizer when plants begin to flower to encourage vigorous growth and pod development.<br><br>
            <strong>Weed Control:</strong><br>
            Keep the lentil field free from weeds, which compete with plants for nutrients, water, and sunlight.<br>
            Use mechanical cultivation, mulching, or herbicides to control weed growth as needed, taking care to avoid damage to lentil plants.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>October to December (Maturation and Harvesting)</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Ripening Stage:</strong><br>
            Monitor lentil plants for signs of maturity, including yellowing and drying of leaves and pods.<br>
            Allow lentil pods to mature fully on the plant, as indicated by a firm texture and a change in color from green to brown.<br><br>
            <strong>Harvesting:</strong><br>
            Harvest lentils when pods are fully mature and dry, typically 90-120 days after planting, depending on the variety and local conditions.<br>
            Test a few pods for readiness by pressing them between your fingers; if the seeds are hard and dry, the lentils are ready for harvest.<br>
            Use sharp knives or shears to cut lentil plants at ground level, then collect the pods and remove the seeds.<br><br>
            <strong>Post-Harvest Management:</strong><br>
            Clean and dry harvested lentils thoroughly before storage to prevent mold growth and maintain quality.<br>
            Store dried lentils in a cool, dry place in airtight containers to preserve freshness and prevent insect infestations.<br>
