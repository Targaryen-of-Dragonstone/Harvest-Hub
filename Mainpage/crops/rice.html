        <h2>Rice Details</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Name:</strong> Oryza sativa<br>
            <strong>Origin:</strong> Rice is believed to have originated in Asia, particularly in the regions of China and India, thousands of years ago.<br>
            <strong>Types:</strong> There are two main cultivated species of rice: Oryza sativa (Asian rice) and Oryza glaberrima (African rice). Oryza sativa is further divided into two subspecies: Oryza sativa japonica (short-grain and medium-grain rice) and Oryza sativa indica (long-grain rice).<br>
            <strong>Characteristics:</strong> Rice plants are typically annual grasses with slender stems and long, narrow leaves. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets. The grains, which are the edible part of the plant, are produced within the spikelets.
        </p>
        <h2>Rice Growing Procedure</h2>
        <h3>January to March (Preparation and Planning)</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Site Selection and Land Preparation:</strong><br>
            Select a well-drained field with access to water for irrigation or flooding.<br>
            Clear the field of weeds, debris, and previous crop residues.<br>
            Level the field to ensure uniform water distribution during flooding.<br><br>
            <strong>Soil Preparation:</strong><br>
            Conduct soil tests to determine nutrient levels and pH.<br>
            Based on soil test results, apply fertilizers and soil conditioners as needed.<br>
            Plow or till the soil to improve aeration and incorporate fertilizers.<br><br>
            <strong>Seed Selection and Treatment:</strong><br>
            Choose high-quality rice seeds suited to your climate and soil conditions.<br>
            Treat seeds with fungicides or pesticides to prevent seed-borne diseases.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>April to June (Planting and Early Growth)</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Nursery Preparation:</strong><br>
            Prepare a seedbed or nursery area for germinating rice seeds.<br>
            Sow seeds densely in prepared nursery beds and keep them well-watered.<br><br>
            <strong>Transplanting:</strong><br>
            When seedlings are around 25-30 days old and have 3-4 leaves, they are ready for transplanting.<br>
            Prepare the main field by flooding it with water.<br>
            Transplant seedlings into the flooded field at a spacing appropriate for your rice variety.<br><br>
            <strong>Water Management:</strong><br>
            Maintain a shallow layer of water (2-5 cm) in the field to keep the soil saturated.<br>
            Monitor water levels closely to prevent waterlogging or drought stress.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>July to September (Growth and Development)</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Nutrient Management:</strong><br>
            Apply additional fertilizer doses based on soil nutrient levels and crop growth stage.<br>
            Monitor nutrient deficiencies and address them promptly.<br><br>
            <strong>Weed Control:</strong><br>
            Keep the field free from weeds, which compete with rice plants for nutrients and water.<br>
            Use manual weeding or herbicides as necessary, taking care to minimize damage to rice plants.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>October to December (Maturation and Harvesting)</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Ripening Stage:</strong><br>
            As the rice plants mature, reduce water levels in the field to promote grain filling and prevent lodging.<br>
            Monitor the crop for signs of maturity, such as yellowing of leaves and grains turning golden.<br><br>
            <strong>Harvesting:</strong><br>
            Harvest rice when grains are fully mature but still moist. This typically occurs around 30-45 days after flowering.<br>
            Use traditional methods like manual cutting with sickles or mechanized harvesters.<br>
            Dry harvested rice grains thoroughly before storage to prevent mold growth.<br><br>
            <strong>Post-Harvest Management:</strong><br>
            Thresh the harvested rice to separate grains from the straw.<br>
            Clean and sort the grains to remove debris and damaged kernels.<br>
            Store rice in a cool, dry place to maintain quality and prevent pests.<br>
