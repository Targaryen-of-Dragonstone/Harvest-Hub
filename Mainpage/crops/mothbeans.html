        <h2>Moth Bean Details</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Name:</strong> Vigna aconitifolia<br>
            <strong>Origin:</strong> Moth beans, also known as matki or Turkish gram, originated in India and are widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions.<br>
            <strong>Characteristics:</strong> Moth bean plants are annual legumes with branching stems and trifoliate leaves. They produce small, yellow flowers that develop into pods containing 2-8 seeds each. The seeds, which are small and round, vary in color from brown to green, and are the edible part of the plant.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>Moth Bean Growing Procedure</h2>
        <h3>January to March (Preparation and Planning)</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Site Selection and Land Preparation:</strong><br>
            Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil for planting moth beans.<br>
            Clear the field of weeds, debris, and any obstacles that may hinder planting or growth.<br>
            Conduct soil tests to determine nutrient levels and pH, and amend the soil as needed.<br><br>
            <strong>Soil Preparation:</strong><br>
            Till the soil to a depth of 6-8 inches to loosen it and improve aeration.<br>
            Incorporate organic matter, such as compost or aged manure, to enrich the soil and provide essential nutrients.<br>
            Create raised beds or rows for planting, with spacing appropriate for the moth bean variety.<br><br>
            <strong>Seed Selection and Treatment:</strong><br>
            Choose high-quality moth bean seeds suited to your climate and soil conditions.<br>
            Treat seeds with fungicides or insecticides to protect against seed-borne diseases and pests.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>April to June (Planting and Early Growth)</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Planting:</strong><br>
            Sow moth bean seeds directly into the prepared soil once the danger of frost has passed and soil temperatures reach at least 70°F (21°C).<br>
            Plant seeds at a depth of 1-2 inches and spacing of 4-6 inches apart within rows, with rows spaced 18-24 inches apart.<br>
            Ensure adequate soil moisture for germination and early growth by watering gently after planting.<br><br>
            <strong>Water Management:</strong><br>
            Maintain consistent soil moisture throughout the growing season, especially during periods of drought or heat stress.<br>
            Water moth bean plants deeply and evenly, providing 1-1.5 inches of water per week, either through rainfall or irrigation.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>July to September (Growth and Development)</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Nutrient Management:</strong><br>
            Apply balanced fertilizers, rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, to support moth bean growth and development.<br>
            Side-dress nitrogen fertilizer when plants begin to flower to encourage vigorous growth and pod development.<br><br>
            <strong>Weed Control:</strong><br>
            Keep the moth bean field free from weeds, which compete with plants for nutrients, water, and sunlight.<br>
            Use mechanical cultivation, mulching, or herbicides to control weed growth as needed, taking care to avoid damage to moth bean plants.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>October to December (Maturation and Harvesting)</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Ripening Stage:</strong><br>
            Monitor moth bean plants for signs of maturity, including yellowing and drying of leaves and pods.<br>
            Allow moth bean pods to mature fully on the plant, as indicated by a firm texture and a change in color from green to brown.<br><br>
            <strong>Harvesting:</strong><br>
            Harvest moth beans when pods are fully mature and dry, typically 90-120 days after planting, depending on the variety and local conditions.<br>
            Test a few pods for readiness by pressing them between your fingers; if the seeds are hard and dry, the moth beans are ready for harvest.<br>
            Use sharp knives or shears to cut moth bean plants at ground level, then collect the pods and remove the seeds.<br><br>
            <strong>Post-Harvest Management:</strong><br>
            Shell moth bean pods to release the seeds, then clean and dry the seeds thoroughly before storage.<br>
            Store dried moth beans in a cool, dry place in airtight containers to maintain quality and prevent insect infestations.<br>
